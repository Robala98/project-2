The main page uses semantic HTML with the main page utilizing handlebars. There was little CSS used and Javascript was used to run the APIs and for the client-side code. MySQL database has three tables for users info, things to do, and favorites for users wanting to save. Users will also be able to perform the CRUD functions on one of the tables.
